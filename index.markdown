An experienced back-end web developer with a passion for learning and writing clean code.  I love working on software that people use and I like to own my systems end-to-end: implementation, debugging, operating in production and working at scale. 

With over {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2010 }} years of experience I am very comfortable working with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Hotwire (Turbo, Stimulus), JavaScript, web servers, talking to databases, and building systems end-to-end. I’ve also worked with PHP and Typescript.

I currently live in Mérida, Yucatán, México, and I’m looking for opportunities to join a collaborative team where I can contribute quality code, showcase exceptional teamwork, and build products that drive the company mission.

## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer - Welcome Homes
_March 2020 - present_

I am involved in all aspects of the company’s webpage, from public-facing UX/UI to internal and admin tools. I focus on automating the civil engineering processes related to construction and property selection, streamlining workflows wherever possible. Collaborating closely with teams such as sales, civil engineering, and customer experience, I identify, track, and deliver solutions for various issues, features, and system changes. I have developed multiple backend functionalities using Sidekiq, ActiveJob, and ActiveMailer to enhance the user experience and utilized Turbo and Stimulus to improve system interactivity. Additionally, I work with MLS APIs to manage property data and ArcGIS to generate high-resolution interactive maps, enabling engineers to create site plans based on ground conditions. Leveraging PostGIS, I manipulate and search geospatial data efficiently, and I’ve implemented Hubspot API endpoints to facilitate seamless collaboration between the land and sales teams.

### Senior Software Engineer/Project Manager - CoDN
_June 2014 - March 2020_

I managed relationships with clients and third-party providers while overseeing the architecture, design, development, deployment, and operation of Ruby on Rails services. I was responsible for preparing all technical proposals related to software engineering, as well as designing, executing, utilizing, and maintaining software engineering applications. Additionally, I assigned tasks to software engineering personnel, evaluated their performance, and managed their development to ensure the delivery of high-quality results.

### Software Engineer
_September 2010 - June 2014_

I created web pages and web-based enterprise systems from start to finish, developing new features using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails (RoR), and CakePHP to enhance the user experience. I implemented multiple backend functionalities with Sidekiq, ActiveJob, and ActiveMailer, and integrated CSS templates into the RoR and CakePHP asset pipelines. Additionally, I maintained the in-house CMS and managed the integration between the back-end and front-end of web pages to ensure seamless functionality and performance.
